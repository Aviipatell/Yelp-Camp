# YelpCamp
A NodeJS web application for users to post information and reviews regarding their favourite campsites. It includes plenty of features such as user authorization (signing up, logging in as well as admin sign-up), uploading campground photos, searching existing campgrounds, creating new posts (as well as editing and deleting) and posting new comments (as well as editing and deleting). There is also a responsive web design, flash messages which respond to a usersâ€™ interactions with the app, and many more. Made hand in hand with Colt Steele as part of his Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.
